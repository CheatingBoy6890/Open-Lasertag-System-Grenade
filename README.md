Warning: This project uses lasers. Be sure to **always** do your own testing by meassuring voltage and current and by looking in datasheets. I am **not** responsible for any injuries you encounter from using this project. Also make sure to wear proper eye-protection.

<h2>What is Open-Lasertag-System?</h2>
Open-Lasertag-System is our approach to a build Lasertag that can be played anywhere without the need of setting up repeaters or servers, whilst beeing pretty easy to build and extend to fit your needs. It works decentral using a WIFI mesh,so the range and fun extends the more players you have!

Currently the project consists of five parts:

1.  The Taggers are fully functional with features such as different firemodes and score synchronization
2.  The vests are functional and connect wirelessly with the corresponding tagger
3.  Targets : For those who don't want to shoot at each other can just shoot at these. The plan also ist to intergrate the further into the system for modes like capture the Flag
4.  Logger: Counts wich target have been hit by whom
5.  There's a Laser grenade planned

  ## Who are we?

  We are two German students. Since we are twins, we build and programm a lot of projects together. We create all of our projects in our free time. Feel free to mail any questions to cyberfox3801@proton.me .
  We want to motivate people to discover what is possible using 3D printing and microcontrollers. \
  The most productive worker of our small group is our cat Susi. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7617c73a-d89d-487c-a4de-c76f1b3753f4)
