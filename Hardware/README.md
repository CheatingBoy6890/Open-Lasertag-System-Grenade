## General Information 

Warning: This project uses lasers. Be sure to **always** do your own testing by meassuring voltage and current and by looking in datasheets. I am **not** responsible for any injuries you encounter from using this project. Also make sure to wear proper eye-protection.

---- 
I recommend wathing a few sewing tutorials if you have never sewed before. Sewing everything by hand is possible but will take ages, so try to get a sewing machine

-----

**The Grenade runs using 3 1,2V NiMh batteries! Don't use voltages greater than 5V in order to power the Vest.**

----

  **We recommend not to use a laser diode for the grenade, since it can be dangerous. Use a normal IR LED instead.** 

## The code

To flash the program to your ESP8266 you need to have <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and the platformio extension installed. If you haven't you can follow this tutorial:
